Coded in C++

This was a project created by me (Andre Hansen) and two other group members (Ahn and Alissa) for our C++ final project. 

The user is able to play the game controlling the blue ship all four directions with their keyboard’s arrow keys, while also being able to pause the game at any point with the spacebar. There is a scoring system enabled for destroying enemies, with 5 different enemy types (Super Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard and Final Boss). 

If a player’s life falls to 0 their game is done, and their score will go onto the high score table on the main menu. The same happens if the player defeats the final boss. The high scores are saved to a separate text file that will get read every time the game starts.

The Final boss is coded in such a way that when its life falls to certain points it shoots the player more frequently up to a point where the player has to really pay attention what they are doing or its almost impossible to win the game.
